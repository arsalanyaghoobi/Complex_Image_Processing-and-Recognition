# Complex_Image_Processing-and-Recognition
Applying CNN(Conv2D,MaxPooling,Flatten and Dense layers)for processing and recognizing images
The repository at hand is caomparable to the two previous repositories in the way that in the very first one there was no CNN;accrdingly,the loss and acc values were not at all acceptable.In previoues repository I got much better results ,compared to the very first one, applying CNNs but on an prepared and aligned dataset(mnist);while,in the code at hand we can use much more complicated pics with any input size which will be automaticly changed into the one required for processing.
Call back is still applied for controlling the image processing task and not to let the model to over_learn or some other probable troubles by relinquishing the process at an expected valu.
